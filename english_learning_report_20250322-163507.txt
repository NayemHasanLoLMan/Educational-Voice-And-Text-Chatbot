This appears to have been a very brief session with the student and there were no marked exchanges for this session. The student's most recent test showed they have excellent pronunciation and reading skills, but need to focus more on understanding grammar and the correct use of prepositions. By turning their attention towards these areas, they can look to improve their overall language score moving forward. Keep practicing and refining areas of focus!
